# HTML
- Name your file index.html for the homepage

# The Head and The Body
-  In between your &lt;html&gt; tags, create &lt;head&gt;&lt;/head&gt; tags, followed by &lt;body&gt;&lt;/body&gt; tags

# What goes in the head?
- <title>Your Title Goes Here</title> The title will show up on the tab of your webpage
- Put in your <meta> tag, yo!
