The SCRUM process:

1. Backlog refinement: reviewing user stories, making sense of the requirements and work load.

2. Sprint Planning: plan the workload, match abilities with priorities, and set up the scrum board.

3. Daily Scrum Meeting: stand up, say progress since last meeting, what you plan to do before next meetings, and any blockers to your goal.

4. Sprint Review: show the product to owner and stakeholders. Deliver a **finished product.**

5. Sprint Retrospective: learn from mistakes, plan for next time.
